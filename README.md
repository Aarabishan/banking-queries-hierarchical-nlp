# 🏦 Hierarchical Multi-Task NLP Model for Banking Customer Queries
## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an intelligent banking query understanding system using a hierarchical multi-task deep learning approach.
The system is designed to automatically:

- Categorize customer queries into major banking domains
- Classify specific customer intents within each domain
- Predict urgency levels to support priority-based handling

All tasks are solved simultaneously using a single hierarchical 3-headed neural network, improving efficiency, consistency, and real-world applicability.
