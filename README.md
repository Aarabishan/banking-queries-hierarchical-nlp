# 🏦 Hierarchical Multi-task Neural Network for Banking Customer Service

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an intelligent banking query understanding system using a hierarchical multi-task deep learning approach.
The system is designed to automatically:

- Categorize customer queries into major banking domains
- Classify specific customer intents within each domain
- Predict urgency levels to support priority-based handling

All tasks are solved simultaneously using a single hierarchical 3-headed neural network, improving efficiency, consistency, and real-world applicability.

## 🧠 Problem Definition

Banking institutions process millions of customer service inquiries daily, requiring accurate intent 
understanding and assessing urgency for accurate routing, effective resource allocation and timely 
response. Traditional flat classification system may fail to simultaneously capture the both 
customer intent and the service priority, leading to delayed response, misrouting queries, and 
suboptimal customer experience.

## 🎯 Objectives (Proposed Solution)

- Develop a hierarchical multi-task neural network to classify banking queries by
domain, customer intent, and urgency.
- Deploy a functional web application integrating the model with Explainable AI
(XAI) for transparent usage.
- Experiment with a Generative AI model to evaluate advanced performance and
compare with the custom neural network.

## 📈 Business Impact

The proposed solution provides multiple operational advantages such as: 

- Intelligent Routing: Enables routing to specialized teams to automatically. 
- Priority Management: Ensures critical issues receive the immediate attention by urgency 
assessment. 
- Operational Efficiently: Hierarchical processing reduces the decision delay and complexity 
and improves accuracy. 
- Cost optimization: Multi-tasking reduces the infrastructure requirements and maintenance 
cost compared to separate systems.
